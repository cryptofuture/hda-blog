#### How HDA was created

In 2014 with some [luck and confidence](https://github.com/hocza/mdac) I bought hda domain. I always wanted own short domain, not something meaningless, and after I caught hda, I thought thats it!

`/dev/hda` is probably how your first IDE hard drive disk was called. Yes later or on server it was called sda, but for most people it was hda.

> BTW, you do have backups, do you?

After some time I start looking for url-shortening solution, since public URL-shorteners were way too heavy, bad for your privacy or use too many javascript and ads. And I wanted something simple, good for privacy - something I have control on. Best thing I found was [sebas](https://github.com/bastilian/sebas) project.  
Overall idea was great, but it was not much user-friendly. I needed also [android client](https://github.com/cryptofuture/urlhda-android) and [tool](https://github.com/cryptofuture/urlhda/raw/master/script/urlhda) for url-shortening from CLI. 

> This is how [urlhda](http://github.com/cryptofuture/urlhda) and [hda.me](https://hda.me) appeared. 

Since 2013 I had blog on [wordpress.com](https://cryptofuture.wordpress.com/) but I didn't like ads and wordpress itself. After all I dropped
 blog soon, since I had slave feeling using wordpress.com. Reasons using wp.com were: not a blogspot (no Google around), export posts feature, WP was open-source itself, beside connection with gravatar wp.com had good reputation, and I don't need to mess with WP updates on my own server. Blog was planned like mostly cryptocurrencies related blog. And indeed I was in wild cryptocurrencies business a bit.

> BTW, article [cryptocurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency) was created only in 2015 in wikipedia.

In 2016 I decided move to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).  And this is how HDA was created.

#### What HDA stands for

HDA is an acronym for Hard Drive Archive. HDA promotes [Free Software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html) and [Freedom of speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech). HDA recommends you always take backups. HDA also respects your privacy. 

> The only difference between a good HDD/SSD and a bad one, is that the good one hasn't crashed yet.
