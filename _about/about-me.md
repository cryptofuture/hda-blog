I'm Eugene Gusev, freelancer. I started using GNU/Linux as primary OS since Slackware 7.1. Was active local LUG events manager and member till 2012 year.   
Had part in launching Pirate Day in TPB support back in time. I also supported and tried managing local Free Software Day.

After school I lived in China and studied Chinese for one and a half years (great exp., but not mine). Then I worked as Linux System Administrator for two years. Tried self in crypto-currencies investing.  
I helped to create distro for pay-kiosks, knew how pay kiosks work and still under NDA with it. Have some work in team experience as part-timer. Like playing with Android and Java in spare time. I'm nginx fan, and like do crazy things with nginx. I can work and run any Linux distro, but I prefer working with Debian-based and RHEL-based distributions. I use Ubuntu on desktop, mainly since Debian ends like Ubuntu in my hands. LTS live cirle feels more comfortable to me, beside I'm active Apparmor and lauchpad user. 

Sometime ago I dreamed to work in Cloudflare (interesting as highload) or Mozilla (really like what they do), but now I just want do something myself. I really like help people, both like geek and human being. I like freedom freelance gives. And I think that anyone can do cool things in any location. 

I tried myself as a writer too. Still like communicate with my friends from Literature Club. I have a Strat and hope I will find time and might to deal with it too. I'm shy person, but I end with friends in every place I travel, and ask for excuse from anyone I may have forgotten or offend somehow.
