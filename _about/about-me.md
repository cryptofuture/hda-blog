Hi, I'm Eugene Gusev, [Melima Project](https://melima.me) founder.  
I started pretty typical as GNU/Linux user (Slackware 7.1 was my first primary linux distro). And was active local LUG events manager and member till 2012 year.   
Had part in launching Pirate Day in TPB support back in time. I also supported and tried managing local Free Software Day.

After school I lived in China and studied Chinese for one and a half years (great exp., but not mine). Then I worked as Linux System Administrator for two years. Tried self in crypto-currencies investing.  
I helped to create distro for pay-kiosks, have idea how pay kiosks work and still under NDA with it. Have some work in team experience as part-timer. Like playing with Android and Java in spare time. I'm nginx fan, and like do crazy things with it. I can work and run any Linux distro, but I prefer working with Debian-based and RHEL-based distributions. I use Ubuntu on desktop, mainly since Debian ends like Ubuntu in my hands. LTS live cirle feels more comfortable to me, beside I'm active Apparmor and lauchpad user. 

Sometime ago I had a dream to work in Cloudflare (interesting as highload) or Mozilla (really like most things they do), but I decided to play my own game.  

Right now I think I could be considered as crypto-cyrrency investor and programmer. I always search for new fields and new invest opportunities.  

I really like help people, both like geek and human being. I like to do whatever I do. And I think that anyone can do whatever she/he like to do from any location and be good at it.  

I tried myself as a writer too. Still try to communicate with my friends from Literature Club. I have a Strat and hope I will find time and might to deal with it too. I'm shy person, but I end with friends in every place I travel, and ask for excuse from anyone I may have forgotten or offend somehow.
